# ✈️ TravelMan – Travel Manager & Activities Planner Web App

TravelMan is a full-stack web application that automates travel itinerary organization and expense tracking.

Instead of manually copying data from emails and booking confirmations, users simply upload screenshots of flights, hotels, or tickets. The system extracts key information using OCR and AI, then automatically generates a structured itinerary.

This project was developed as a Bachelor Thesis (Computer Science BSc, ELTE, 2024).

## 🏗 Architecture

The application follows a Model–View–Controller (MVC) architecture.

### View
- React frontend
- Component-based UI
- Real-time listeners for database updates

### Controller
- Handles user interactions
- Manages upload flows
- Coordinates OCR + AI pipeline

### Model
- Firestore (Trips, Activities, Expenses)
- Firebase Storage
- Cloud Functions
- OCR Engine
- OpenAI API integration

## 🔄 OCR + AI Processing Pipeline

1. User uploads screenshot
2. File stored in Firebase Storage
3. Cloud Function triggers automatically
4. Google Vision API extracts text
5. Extracted text sent to OpenAI GPT-4
6. GPT returns structured JSON
7. Activities + Expenses saved to Firestore
8. UI updates instantly

## 🗄 Database Structure (Firestore)
Users
Trips
├── activities
├── expenses
└── storage


### Relationships

- One User → Many Trips
- One Trip → Many Activities
- One Trip → Many Expenses
- OCR results stored separately for modular processing
